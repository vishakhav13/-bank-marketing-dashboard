# Bank Marketing Campaign Dashboard

## 📌 Business Problem

A retail bank launched multiple marketing campaigns to promote term deposits. However, they lacked visibility into which channels, customer segments, or campaign types were actually driving conversions.

The marketing team needed to understand:
- Who is most likely to respond to campaigns?
- What time and method (email, phone) work best?
- How can we reduce cost per conversion and improve campaign ROI?

## 🧠 Business Objective

Create a Tableau dashboard that allows stakeholders to analyze:
- Conversion trends across customer segments (age, job, marital status)
- Effectiveness of marketing channels (phone calls, email)
- Campaign outcomes by duration and contact frequency

## 📈 Solution

Built an interactive Tableau dashboard using cleaned and segmented bank marketing data.

### Key Features:
- **Conversion Rate by Demographics**  
- **Channel Performance (Email vs Phone)**  
- **Call Duration vs Success Rate**  
- **Response Rates by Campaign Type and Time**

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Tableau
- Excel (cleaning)
- (Optional: SQL if you used transformations)

## 📊 KPIs Tracked
- Conversion Rate (response = "yes")
- Contact Count per Customer
- Campaign Success % by Job, Age, and Marital Status
- Average Duration vs Conversion Outcome
